## Abstract
>  Forensic pattern evidence is often evaluated using categorical scales, such as identification (evidence is from the same source), inconclusive, or elimination (evidence is from different sources). I will talk about how these evaluations are made, what error rate studies show, and the implications for interpretation of forensic evidence.
