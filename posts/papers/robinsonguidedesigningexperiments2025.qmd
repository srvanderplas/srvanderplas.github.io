### Abstract

In this paper, we discuss considerations and methods for experimentally testing visualizations. We discuss levels of user engagement with graphics, common issues when developing a sampling or data generation model, the importance of pilot testing, and data analysis methods. Along the way, we also provide recommendations of how to avoid some of the unique pitfalls of human testing in statistical and visualization research. This article is categorized under: Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis {$>$} Statistical Graphics and Visualization Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis {$>$} Modeling Methods and Algorithms
