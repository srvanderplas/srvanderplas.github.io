### Abstract

This week will be the first of a 2-part workshop. First, we'll talk about how to make a CV with R and a google spreadsheet (and why you might want to do so). On March 7, we'll talk about how to use this same setup to build a blog-type website with posts for each paper and presentation, using quarto. Setup steps: 1. Create your own CV spreadsheet using this template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11S8-U4vasXgPbW-IKQPCy1nO-1UsmvzNLz7GvdONN_w/edit?usp=sharing . Copy the sheet over to your own google account (File -> make a copy) and fill it in. You don't need to use every tab - I've included many different options that won't apply to everyone (but this setup works for me, so it is a viable long-term solution for an academic). 2. Clone or fork the github repository I've made: https://github.com/srvanderplas/cv-template. 3. You can see the sample CV that I use, but there are other compatible templates if you don't like the timeline look. 4. Modify the bib file in the repository to contain your publications, if you want to include them on the CV. Publications are the one piece of a CV that I find more convenient as a separate file. During the presentation, I'll walk you through the workflow I use and show you how to use the code I've written to write your own CV from a spreadsheet.
