    "section": "About Toolmarks",
    "text": "About Toolmarks\nAs a quick digression, let’s talk about toolmarks. We can look at microscopic imperfections in a wire cut, screwdriver scratch, or plier mark and see striations - little lines that are on the surface of the mark. A scan of a cut wire is shown in Figure 2. A more macroscopic example is when you spread butter on toast, the butter knife often leaves little grooves behind in the butter2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Striations on the surface of a cut wire.\n\n\n\nIn order to assess how many different cutting surfaces there are in a shop, we need to look at the different way tools are configured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Different tool configurations. On the top row, there are cross-sectional shapes representing the blades; each cutting surface that will leave a residual mark on the cut material is numbered. On the bottom, there are examples of tools with this configuration of blades (note that not all similar looking tools are necessarily configured the same).\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the different configurations of blades of common tools that may be used to cut wires in a household environment. When measuring a tool’s cutting length, record the number of cutting surfaces as well as the length of the blade - each surface leaves different impressions and must be compared separately.\nSteps:\n\nGather tools which can be used for wire cutting from your house and shop.\nOpen up the communal Excel sheet and duplicate the sheet labeled Template.\nRename the new sheet to an identifier you would like me to use (I’m not publishing this data - this is just for internal purposes). This identifier will ensure that no one overwrites your data accidentally (hopefully).\nFor each tool type, record the blade length (in cm), number of cutting surfaces, and (if there are multiple tools with the same cutting surface configuration and blade length) number of tools. Reporting blade length to the nearest mm is fine, as is estimation if it is difficult to precisely measure the tool.\n\nThank you so much for your help!"

    "text": "This week will be the first of a 2-part workshop. First, we’ll talk about how to make a CV with R and a google spreadsheet (and why you might want to do so). On March 7, we’ll talk about how to use this same setup to build a blog-type website with posts for each paper and presentation, using quarto. Setup steps:\n 1. Create your own CV spreadsheet using this template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11S8-U4vasXgPbW-IKQPCy1nO-1UsmvzNLz7GvdONN_w/edit?usp=sharing . Copy the sheet over to your own google account (File -&gt; make a copy) and fill it in. You don't need to use every tab - I've included many different options that won't apply to everyone (but this setup works for me, so it is a viable long-term solution for an academic).\n 2. Clone or fork the github repository I've made: https://github.com/srvanderplas/cv-template.\n 3. You can see the sample CV that I use, but there are other compatible templates if you don't like the timeline look.\n 4. Modify the bib file in the repository to contain your publications, if you want to include them on the CV. Publications are the one piece of a CV that I find more convenient as a separate file.\nDuring the presentation, I’ll walk you through the workflow I use and show you how to use the code I’ve written to write your own CV from a spreadsheet."

    "title": "Animint: Interactive Web-Based Animations using Ggplot2’s Grammar of Graphics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Animint is a high-level modification of the grammar of graphics used in ggplot2 for linked, interactive, animated plots. It builds on top of ggplot2 to create interactive visualizations using web standards (D3 in JavaScript). In other data visualization systems, interactive animations are difficult to accomplish, since they must be defined in terms of low-level operations and sometimes 100s of lines of code. In contrast, Animint’s high-level grammar can be used to produce a wide variety of complex interactive visualizations with only 10s of lines of code. It works by adding 2 new aesthetics to the grammar of graphics used in ggplot2: clickSelects, which allows users to select elements of the plot, and showSelected, which displays only elements corresponding to the current selection. After creating the interactive animation in R code, it is compiled and rendered in a web browser using D3. We discuss the design of Animint, then compare to related libraries, and show several example visualizations of high-dimensional time series data."

What were the latest case counts? How many people were in ICUs? What were epidemiological models predicting the case load would be in a month? In response, journalists, academics, and amateurs generated an astonishing amount of visualizations. Novel graphical forms and approaches to the data appeared amid the more traditional maps and case count charts. This creativity was in part a result of the challenges of depicting data which was exponentially increasing, from countries and states with vast differences in population size and different dates of initial infection, resulting from an assortment of testing strategies and public health interventions. Some approaches distilled complex information down into very simple (but imprecise) representations, while others provided incredibly detailed data that obscured the messy real-world situation with precise numbers and ratios. These graphics and trade offs highlight how little we know about graphical perception and visual numeracy, and how important it is to understand the impact of graphical design choices when communicating scientific information in a visual domain. Using COVID-related graphics, this presentation will examine what we know, what we think we know, and what we still need to explore to create useful, accurate, and informative statistical graphics."

Generally, the brain processes potential ambiguities in the rendering as the most-common three-dimensional object. This can lead to visual distortions, such as occur with the Necker figure or in the Muller-Lyer illusion. We discuss the underlying psychological mechanisms for the distortions, examine the effect these distortions have on judgments, and consider the implications for graph design.

Generally, the brain processes potential ambiguities in the rendering as the most-common three-dimensional object. This can lead to visual distortions, such as occur with the Necker figure or in the Muller-Lyer illusion. We discuss the underlying psychological mechanisms for the distortions, examine the effect these distortions have on judgments, and consider the implications for graph design. Using the sine illusion as a case study, we quantify the effects of the distortion that create a “perceptual lie factor” for the sine illusion."
