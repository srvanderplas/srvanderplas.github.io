### Abstract

Hullman and Gelman (2021, this issue) have provided a very thorough discussion of the premise that interactive exploratory data analysis requires a theoretical framework for graphical inference to effectively support the analyst and counter any tendencies towards assuming all results are real and not just due to sample variability. Unfortunately, the theoretical framework for model checking during exploratory and confirmatory data analysis proposed in this paper is just another conceptual and theoretical framework that is difficult to test or falsify as presented.
