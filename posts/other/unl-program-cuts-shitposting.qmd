Today is the last day that UNL is allowing public comments about program closures, so I've been having a bit of fun shitposting comments on behalf of the departments proposed for closure. 
This started when I asked ChatGPT to generate a not-the-onion post about the statistics department being closed due to the UNL administration's bad use of statistics. 
I've and edited and annotated the statistics version (and changed names and positions at will to reflect administrators -- departmental characters are all as GPT generated them). 

For other departments, I have largely left the poems unedited.

## Statistics

### University Administration Uses Faulty Statistics to Justify Eliminating Statistics Department

> “P-Value Was Below Our Standards for Caring,” Says Chancellor

In a move described by many as “poetically idiotic,” the administration of Midwestern State University announced Monday its plan to eliminate the Department of Statistics—citing a data analysis later revealed to have been performed using Microsoft Excel’s AutoSum function.

According to the administration’s official report^[Already, ChatGPT is assuming an administration is more competent than ours is...], “a thorough statistical analysis” demonstrated that the department was “statistically insignificant” to the university’s mission. When pressed for details, Chancellor Bodney Rennett clarified, “The p-value was really high—like, I think, 70 or 80 percent—so we’re confident this was the right call.”

Faculty members within the Statistics Department expressed mixed feelings ranging from disbelief to the quiet satisfaction of being proven right one last time.

“They told us they ran a regression model,” said Dr. Alan Brooks, head of the department. “Then we found out they just drew a line through a scatterplot and said, ‘Looks flat enough.’ I’m not even mad—that’s almost elegant in its ignorance."^[Ok, so visual regression is an actual thing, thank you very much...]

The university’s analysis reportedly concluded that student interest in statistics had “declined by 200%” over the past decade. When asked how a percentage could exceed 100%, the administration explained that “it just means students are twice as uninterested.”^[This is actually a better explanation than the one we got, which was "the metrics are the metrics, and we're not changing them."]

Administrators also cited “strong anecdotal data” from a campus-wide survey showing low awareness of the department’s existence. However, the survey was distributed exclusively to the football team during spring break.

“We stand by our numbers,” said Bark Mutton, Executive Vice Chancellor of Academic Optimization. “We even used one of those fancy pivot thingies. The results were clear: no one knows what a median is, and that’s the department’s fault.”

Dosh Javis, Associate Chancellor of Strategic Analytics (Business Edition), supported the decision. “Our chi-squared test came out looking real weird, which probably means it’s significant,” Javis said. “We confirmed this by looking at the vibes.”

In response, the department offered to teach the administration how to correctly analyze the data^[Yep, we did actually offer this, but they did not take us up on that.]—an offer the administration declined on the grounds that “it sounded expensive and mathy.”^[Again, this is a better explanation than what we got, which was... ignored.]

Rumors suggest the university will reallocate the department’s funding to expand the Business Analytics program, which “does the same thing, but with prettier dashboards.”

Students and alumni have since launched a petition to save the department, though early analysis indicates it may not be effective: the administration reportedly used a random number generator to sample the signatures and found “insufficient support.”^[A random number generator might actually have better accuracy than the analysis method they used to eliminate our department, lol.]

As for the soon-to-be-dismantled statisticians, they remain philosophical.

“In the end,” Dr. Brooks said, “this outcome was predictable. The confidence interval for administrative understanding of statistics has always included zero.”

When asked whether the administration had any regrets, Chancellor Rennett sighed. “If we’ve learned anything,” he said, “it’s that we probably should have hired some statisticians before getting rid of them.”
