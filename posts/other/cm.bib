	abstract = {Graphical perception is the visual decoding of categorical and quantitative information from a graph. Increasing our basic understanding of graphical perception will allow us to make graphs that convey quantitative information to viewers with more accuracy and efficiency. This paper describes an experiment that was conducted to investigate the accuracy of six basic judgments of graphical perception. Two types of position judgments were found to be the most accurate, length judgments were second, angle and slope judgments were third, and area judgments were last. Distance between judged objects was found to be a factor in the accuracy of the basic judgments.},

	abstract = {Studies in graphical perception, both theoretical and experimental, provide a scientific foundation for the construction area of statistical graphics. From these studies a paradigm that has important applications for practice has begun to emerge. The paradigm is based on elementary codes: Basic geometric and textural aspects of a graph that encode the quantitative information. The methodology that can be invoked to study graphical perception is illustrated by an investigation of the shape parameter of a two-variable graph, a topic that has had much discussion, but little scientific study, for at least 70 years.},

Recent investigations have uncovered basic principles of human graphical perception that have important implications for the display of data. The computer graphics revolution has stimulated the invention of many graphical methods for analyzing and presenting scientific data, such as box plots, two-tiered error bars, scatterplot smoothing, dot charts, and graphing on a log base 2 scale.},
