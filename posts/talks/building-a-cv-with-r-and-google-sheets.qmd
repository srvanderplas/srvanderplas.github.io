## Abstract
>  This week will be the first of a 2-part workshop. First, we'll talk about how to make a CV with R and a google spreadsheet (and why you might want to do so). On March 7, we'll talk about how to use this same setup to build a blog-type website with posts for each paper and presentation, using quarto. Setup steps:
>    
>      1. Create your own CV spreadsheet using this template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11S8-U4vasXgPbW-IKQPCy1nO-1UsmvzNLz7GvdONN_w/edit?usp=sharing . Copy the sheet over to your own google account (File -> make a copy) and fill it in. You don't need to use every tab - I've included many different options that won't apply to everyone (but this setup works for me, so it is a viable long-term solution for an academic).
>      2. Clone or fork the github repository I've made: https://github.com/srvanderplas/cv-template.
>      3. You can see the sample CV that I use, but there are other compatible templates if you don't like the timeline look.
>      4. Modify the bib file in the repository to contain your publications, if you want to include them on the CV. Publications are the one piece of a CV that I find more convenient as a separate file.
>    During the presentation, I'll walk you through the workflow I use and show you how to use the code I've written to write your own CV from a spreadsheet.
