## Abstract
>  In this talk, I walk through a few cognitive components that affect how we use charts: perception, attention, and memory, with a focus on the process of understanding and using the data displayed in charts. To do this, I lean heavily on Padilla et al. (2018) (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-018-0120-9), as well as examples that allow you to see these processes at work in your own mind.
