## Abstract
>  If data creates problems, then big data creates even bigger problems. In this talk, I discuss many different ways you can ensure a study fails, and how those decisions are magnified in "big data" settings. If you've ever thought pilot studies are a waste of time, or that planning your data analysis before data collection begins is for losers, or if you think of your instrumentation as a magic box that produces data, this talk is for you. Using several recent experiments which generated TB of data, I talk about the analysis of misshapen, noisy, and problematic data, and how to avoid these pitfalls in during experimental design and data collection.
