## Abstract
>  This week will be the second of a 2-part workshop. On Feb 15, we talked about how to make a CV with R and a google spreadsheet (and why you might want to do so). This week, we'll talk about how to use this same setup to build a blog-type website with posts for each paper and presentation, using quarto. Setup steps: 1. Clone or fork the github repository I've made: https://github.com/srvanderplas/cv-site-template. 2. Modify the data/CV.bib file in the repository to contain your publications, if you want to include them on the CV. 3. Modify the data/CV.xlsx file in the repository to contain your talks During the presentation, I'll walk you through the workflow I use and show you how to use the code I've written to create your own CV-style blog from a spreadsheet and a bib file. We'll also talk about how to use this workflow, git submodules, and github actions to automatically keep things updated.
