This post concerns @clevelandGraphicalPerceptionTheory1984, @clevelandGraphicalPerceptionGraphical1985, @clevelandExperimentGraphicalPerception1986, and @clevelandGraphicalPerceptionVisual1987. 

## Experiments performed

- position-length (1984)
    - 55 subjects, 5 types of charts
    ![@clevelandGraphicalPerceptionTheory1984, Fig 4, recreated.](CM1984Fig4.svg)
    - Comparisons
        - Grouped bar charts: second and third bars of the left group or second bars of the two groups. 
        - Stacked bar charts: bottom divisions of the two bars or in the top divisions of the two bars or in the top divisions of the left bar.
        - Type 1-3: position on common scale, Type 4-5: length
    - Composition of bars
        - Values $s_i = 10 \times 10^{(i - 1)/12}, i = 1, ..., 10$, `r round(10* 10^((0:9)/12), 3)`
        - Subjects judged ratios of 10 pairs of values ranging from 0.18 to 0.83; each pair of values judged 5x (one per comparison type)
      - Other segment heights chosen at random subject to constraints to prevent common-scale judgments.
    - Procedure for a graph:
      - indicate which was smaller
      - judge what percentage the smaller was of the larger
      
    - only 4 errors in which bar/segment was smaller
    - Kits
        - Charts on 8.5x11 page, filling a large portion of the page
        - 5 practice graphs (one of each type) + 50 graphs in random order
        - all packets identical

- position-angle (1984)
    - 54 subjects, 2 types of charts
